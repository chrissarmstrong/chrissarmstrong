ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @chrissarmstrong

Iâ€™m interested in machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. Studying this stuff since 2018 but still something of a newbie. Recently I'm interested in the intersection of neuroscience and AI; namely, what can we learn from the way human and other animal brains work to improve AI?
