ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @chrissarmstrong

Iâ€™m interested in machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. Studying this stuff since 2018 but still something of a newbie. Recently I'm digging into the intersection of neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; namely, what can we learn from the way human and other animal brains work to advance AI?
