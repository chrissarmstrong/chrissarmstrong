ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @chrissarmstrong

Iâ€™m interested in machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. Studying this stuff since 2018 but still consider myself coming up to speed. Recently I'm digging into the intersection of neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; namely, what can we learn from the way human and other animal brains work to advance AI?
